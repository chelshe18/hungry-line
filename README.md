## About Hungry Line

"Hungry Line" is a React Native app designed for use on devices like iOS and Android. This app offers users the ability to queue online. It enables users to seamlessly join a dining hall line from any location and grants access to the dining hall when their turn arrives. This approach provides users with additional time for traveling to the dining hall and being more productive during the waiting period.

We utilized Figma to design our application and opted for a warm color palette to evoke sensations of comfort and coziness. This choice aligns with our objective of creating an environment where users feel at home while navigating through our app.
